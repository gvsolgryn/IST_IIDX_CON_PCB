$CMP JUMPER-SMT_2_NO_NO-SILK
D Normally open jumper This jumper has two pads in close proximity to each other. Apply solder to close the connection. Round pads are easier to solder for beginners, but are a lot larger. SparkFun Product that uses the round pads:<ul><li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12781">SparkFun EL Sequencer</a></li></ul>

$CMP JUMPER-SMT_2_NC_TRACE_NO-SILK
D Normally closed trace jumper This jumper has a trace between two pads so it's normally closed (NC). Use a razor knife to open the connection. For best results follow the IPC guidelines for cutting traces: <ul><li>Cutout at least 0.063 mm (0.005 in).</li><li>Remove all loose material to clean up the cut area.</li><li>Seal the cut with an approved epoxy.</li></ul>Reapply solder to reclose the connection.
